## Overview

Cursor AI IDE is a revolutionary programming tool developed by Anysphere Inc. that deeply integrates with advanced artificial intelligence models like Claude AI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), providing developers with an unprecedented coding experience. As an "AI-first" code editor, Cursor not only inherits all the advantages of traditional IDEs but also introduces powerful artificial intelligence capabilities to help developers significantly improve coding efficiency and quality.

## Core Technologies and Architecture

### Basic Architecture

Cursor's core architecture is built on Visual Studio Code, retaining VS Code's familiar interface and operation logic while undergoing deep customization and enhancement. This design enables VS Code users to seamlessly transition to Cursor while enjoying enhanced AI functionality.

### AI Model Integration

Cursor integrates multiple advanced AI models, including:

- **GPT-4**: Provides powerful code generation and understanding capabilities
- **Anthropic Claude**: Provides high-quality code suggestions and explanations through deep integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol is a core technology component of Cursor that allows Cursor to efficiently exchange contextual information with AI models (such as Claude). MCP enables AI to:

- Understand the developer's entire code base structure
- Obtain file system information
- Analyze code dependencies
- Accurately grasp the code context
- Provide more precise suggestions and modifications

This deep contextual awareness makes Cursor's AI suggestions far beyond traditional code completion functions, capable of understanding the overall structure and development intentions of the project.

## Detailed Explanation of Core Functions

### Intelligent Code Completion (Tab)

Cursor's code completion function transcends traditional syntax-based completion and provides true intelligent completion:

- **Context-Aware Completion**: Intelligent completion based on the current file, project structure, and coding history
- **Whole Block Code Generation**: Able to generate complete functions, classes, and modules, not limited to single lines of code
- **Multi-Line Completion**: Predicts and generates possible next lines of code, or even entire code blocks
- **Style Adaptation**: Learns and adapts to the developer's coding style and preferences
- **Real-Time Suggestions**: Provides intelligent suggestions in real-time during input

Usage: By default, press the `Tab` key to accept the suggestion, and press the `Esc` key to reject it.

### Unified AI Interface

Cursor provides a unified AI interaction interface, integrating three working modes:

#### Ask Mode

- Ask questions about specific code segments and get explanations
- Understand how complex functions work
- Find code patterns and examples
- Explore and understand the code base structure

Usage: Use the shortcut `⌘I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux) to open the Composer, which defaults to Ask Mode.

#### Edit Mode

- Use natural language descriptions to make precise modifications to the code
- Implement single-turn code editing and optimization
- View and apply AI-suggested modifications
- Handle code changes within a single file

Usage: Switch to Edit Mode in the Composer, or use the shortcut `⌘K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux).

#### Agent Mode

As the default mode, Agent Mode provides the most powerful functionality:

- Implement code base-wide modifications and refactoring across files
- Implement new features from requirement descriptions
- Debug complex issues across multiple files
- Generate tests and documentation
- Maintain consistency throughout the project

Usage: Default to Agent Mode, or switch manually in the Composer.

### Context Management

Cursor provides tools to precisely control the context accessible to AI:

- **Automatic Indexing**: Automatically indexes code when opening the code base, making it available as context for AI
- **@ Symbol Control**: Use special syntax to precisely control the context provided to AI
  - `@files` and `@folders`: Specify specific paths
  - `@web`: Use external documents as context
  - `@git`: Provide version control context

### Intelligent Debugging and Error Fixing

- **Error Prediction**: Predict possible errors during coding and provide repair suggestions
- **Code Analysis**: Deeply analyze code logic to discover potential issues
- **Real-Time Repair Suggestions**: Provide intelligent repair options for detected errors
- **Exception Handling Suggestions**: Recommend appropriate exception handling methods

### Multi-Language Support

Cursor supports almost all mainstream programming languages, including but not limited to:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Java
- C/C++
- Go
- Rust
- PHP
- Ruby
- Swift
- Kotlin

For each language, Cursor will provide language-specific intelligent suggestions and best practices.

## Advanced Usage Tips

### Code Refactoring

Use Agent Mode for complex code refactoring:

1. Open the Composer (`⌘I`/`Ctrl+I`)
2. Describe the refactoring you want to perform (e.g., "decompose this single class into multiple classes that conform to the single responsibility principle")
3. The Agent will analyze the code, suggest refactoring strategies, and execute the refactoring after confirmation

### Comment Generation and Explanation

Cursor can generate high-quality code comments:

1. Select the code that needs to be commented
2. Use `⌘K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux)
3. Enter "add detailed comments to this code"
4. Cursor will generate professional comments that conform to the project style

### Test Generation

Automatically generate test code:

1. Select the function or class to be tested
2. In the Composer, request "generate unit tests for this function"
3. Cursor will analyze the function behavior and generate appropriate test cases

### Custom AI Rules

You can customize the behavior of AI by defining rules:

1. Create a `.cursorignore` file in the project root directory to define files to be ignored
2. Use "Rules for AI" in Cursor settings to customize the behavior of the AI assistant (e.g., coding style, comment format, etc.)

## Integration and Workflow

### Integration with Version Control Systems

Cursor seamlessly integrates with version control systems such as Git:

- **Intelligent Commit Messages**: Automatically generate descriptive commit messages
- **Change Analysis**: Analyze code changes before committing
- **Conflict Resolution**: Assist in resolving merge conflicts

### Team Collaboration Features

Cursor provides features to enhance team collaboration:

- **Code Review Assistance**: Analyze code changes and provide review suggestions
- **Consistency Checks**: Ensure consistent code style within the team
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Help new team members understand the code base through AI assistance
