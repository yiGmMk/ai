## What is Alfred?

If you're a Mac user and have been searching for the ultimate weapon to boost your productivity, you can't miss Alfred. Alfred is a powerful productivity tool that is much more than a simple application launcher. You can think of it as a super-enhanced version of Spotlight, a personal assistant that can help you accomplish almost any task through keyboard shortcuts, keywords, and custom workflows.

Alfred's functionality is powerful, and its integration with AI gives it wings. Let's see the effect, implemented using a plugin created by the master **sunzsh**:

## Implementation

- [Open source repository, plugin created by sunzsh](https://github.com/sunzsh/favoritesWorkflow4Alfred), https://github.com/sunzsh/favoritesWorkflow4Alfred/blob/main/AI%E5%B0%8F%E5%8A%A9%E6%89%8B.alfredworkflow

**Note**:

The AI Assistant.alfredworkflow is still in the testing phase.
Because this plugin can **directly run scripts written by AI**, **there may be risks of data and file deletion during use**. Using this plugin means you are willing to bear the risks. **The plugin author and this site do not assume any responsibility**.

Latest version: v0.0.5
Utilizing the Function Call of large models, it allows the large model to simply operate our computer to achieve some functions.
In theory, it supports all large model interfaces that comply with the OpenAI specification. The following vendors have been tested: Volcano Engine, Alibaba Cloud Bailian, Zhipu AI, DeepSeek official (others not tested does not mean they cannot be used).

## Core Features

Alfred's power lies in its rich and highly customizable features.

### 1. Smart Search

Alfred's basic function is to quickly launch applications and find files, but it does it better.

*   **Application Launch**: Press `‚å• + Space` (default shortcut), type a few letters of the application name, and press Enter to launch.
*   **File Search**: Type `find` or `open` followed by the file name to quickly locate any file deep on your computer.
*   **Web Search**: Type keywords like `google`, `wiki`, `youtube`, followed by your search query, to open the search results directly in your browser without opening the browser first. You can also customize searches for any website.

### 2. Workflows

This is Alfred's most powerful feature and the reason it's considered legendary (requires purchasing the Powerpack). Workflows allow you to connect a series of actions to create an automated task flow. There are thousands of community-created workflows available online, and you can also create your own.

Some popular Workflow examples:

*   **Dash Integration**: Search Dash documentation directly within Alfred.
*   **Youdao Translate**: Type `yd` followed by a word or sentence to get an instant translation.
*   **IP Address Query**: Type `ip` to see your current public and private IP addresses.
*   **Music Control**: Control play, pause, and next track for Spotify or Apple Music directly with keywords, without switching to the app.

### 3. Clipboard History

Have you ever lost important information you copied because you copied something new? Alfred's clipboard history feature can remember all the text, images, and file links you've copied. You can search and paste from your history at any time.

### 4. Snippets

For repetitive text you frequently type, such as email addresses, code blocks, or common replies, you can create Snippets. Just type a short keyword, and Alfred will automatically expand it into the full text, saving a significant amount of typing time.

### 5. System Commands

You can execute various system commands without leaving your keyboard:

*   `emptytrash`: Empty the Trash
*   `sleep`: Put your Mac to sleep
*   `restart` / `shutdown`: Restart or shut down
*   `eject`: Eject all mounted disks

## Why Choose Alfred?

*   **Extreme Speed**: Once you get used to it, your hands will barely leave the keyboard, and your operations will be fluid.
*   **Highly Customizable**: From themes to functionality, almost everything can be customized to your liking.
*   **Powerful Community**: There are countless ready-made Workflows to download, so you can always find a tool that meets your needs.
*   **Saves Time**: Through automation and shortcuts, you can save a lot of valuable time in the long run.

## Summary

Alfred is a tool worth investing in for every Mac user. It's not just a launcher, but a powerful platform that can be integrated into your workflow to boost productivity. Once you start using it and configure the right Workflows for yourself, you'll find you can't live without it.
