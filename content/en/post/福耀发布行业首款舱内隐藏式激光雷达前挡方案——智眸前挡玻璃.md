Recently, Fuyao's innovative **"Smart Eye" windshield** was officially unveiled at the Shanghai Auto Show and is featured for the first time on the Cadillac VISTIQ model. This is the **industry's first in-cabin hidden LiDAR windshield solution**, drawing significant attention from the industry. The Fuyao Smart Eye windshield deeply integrates the LiDAR sensor with the car's windshield, providing a simpler and more reliable solution for intelligent driving perception systems.

With the rapid development of intelligent driving, LiDAR is considered a core sensor for semi-autonomous and fully autonomous driving. It mainly uses laser beams to accurately detect the distance and contours of objects, providing crucial data for functions such as AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking) and adaptive cruise control. Unlike ultrasonic and camera sensors, it can detect distances up to 500 meters and directly obtain the distance and azimuth information of objects without the need for deep learning algorithms.

Currently, the mainstream installation methods for vehicle LiDAR on the market mostly involve external mounting on the roof, bumpers, or headlights. These methods have issues such as being **easily soiled and difficult to clean, prone to damage, potential blind spots, disruption of the vehicle's streamlined design, and increased wind resistance**. In response to these market pain points, Fuyao has innovatively launched the "Smart Eye" windshield – placing the LiDAR inside the windshield, with the core concept of "in-cabin integration," offering the following advantages:

**No Fear of Dirt, Worry-Free Maintenance**

Whether facing poor visibility in rain, snow, mud, or dust, or encountering oncoming insects during long-distance driving, the existing wiper system can quickly clean the windshield, **effectively preventing external environmental interference with the LiDAR's sensitivity**. At the same time, the hidden design of the LiDAR behind the windshield also reduces the risk of damage to costly components in daily collisions.

**Styling Integration, Wind Resistance Optimization**

The in-cabin hidden design avoids protruding structures on the roof, preventing abrupt designs that make the car look like it has "horns," **making the body lines smoother and reducing the drag coefficient**, which simultaneously improves range and quietness.

**Undistorted Signal, Accurate Detection**

Addressing the issue of LiDAR signal attenuation caused by the curved windshield structure, Fuyao has successfully achieved **high near-infrared light transmission requirements for the windshield through years of technological breakthroughs, such as applying innovative materials and improving production processes**. Even in complex road conditions, the Smart Eye windshield, combined with the LiDAR's ultra-long-range measurement, can predict road conditions in advance and significantly improve the reliability of the autonomous driving system.

The Smart Eye windshield can also be perfectly integrated with existing ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), not only meeting the reliability requirements of the assembly solution but also considering aesthetic design. In addition, this solution is compatible with multiple functions such as **HUD (Head-Up Display) and coated heat insulation**, achieving **multiple uses in one glass**, providing users with comprehensive comfort and safety protection. Currently, the Fuyao Smart Eye windshield has mass production capabilities, can accept global customer orders, and ensure high-quality delivery standards.

The Smart Eye windshield is a milestone achievement for Fuyao in the field of intelligent driving. In the future, Fuyao will continue to be an explorer as a professional automotive glass supplier, playing a supporting role in the automotive industry, continuously exploring the deep integration of glass and intelligent hardware, providing the industry with more efficient and reliable solutions, constantly pursuing excellence, and never stopping.
