## 🔑 Key Features and Functionality

### 🤖 AI Techniques

Shortcut AI integrates three core AI technologies:

| Technique                             | Functionality                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** | Users interact via plain English (e.g., *"Create a revenue forecast for the next quarter"*), which is translated into executable commands.                                     |
| **Machine Learning (ML)**             | Powers predictive modeling using historical data. Likely employs regression, time series analysis, and possibly neural networks (though specifics are not publicly disclosed). |
| **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)**  | Automates repetitive workflows such as data extraction from PDFs, report generation, and cross-sheet updates.                                                                  |

### 📊 Data Handling Capabilities

- **Messy Data Cleanup**: Uses AI to detect anomalies, impute missing values, normalize formats, and suggest corrections.
- **Financial Model Construction**: Interprets natural language to build complete models (e.g., *"Build a DCF model"*) with correct formulas and logic.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Monitors external data sources and auto-refreshes spreadsheets to ensure up-to-date models and reports.
